# TAO GIOP Fragmentation Bug
## Reproduces a bug when GIOP fragmentation is used 

The server returns a string sequence with two elements, the first is a long 4MB string
with repeating character 'A', the second element is the string "Hello World". If
one removes the command line parameters ```-ORBMaxMessageSize 1048576``` from ```run_test.pl```
everything works as expected, but with these settings, which cause GIOP fragmentation,
the client receives an empty string as the second element of the sequence.

We discovered problems in a more complicated application when big sequences are returned,
often the client encountering ```CORBA::MARSHAL``` or ```CORBA::COMM_FAILURE``` exceptions. In one case,
it worked if the sequence contained a single element, even if big, but a small second
element caused client exceptions. The complex application encountered problems with big
sequences even without the ```-ORBMaxMessageSize``` parameter, but problems start at
smaller sizes if it is used.
